# The Urban Tree Canopy Cover in South America


##
To better service South Americaâ€™s urban ecosystem, we developed a semi-supervised deep learning method, which is able to learn semantic segmentation knowledge from both labeled and unlabeled images, to segment urban trees from high spatial resolution remote sensing images. The approach attains significant improvement over existing methods, especially when trained with limited labeled samples. 
Using this approach, we created 0.5 m fine-scale tree canopy products for  cities in South America. The created UTC map products of cities in South America were freely accessible at ([UTCSA](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dlAOe4zDY9mYkxniSrUh8pZfQlzl12Gd?usp=drive_linkk)).

## Study area
South America is a continent located in the Western Hemisphere of the Earth, primarily in the Southern Hemisphere. It is the fourth-largest continent by area, covering approximately 17.8 million square kilometers (6.9 million square miles) and is home to a diverse range of cultures, languages, and landscapes.

## Methods

In this study, we used the same semi-supervised learning framework to train two CNN models for urban tree and mask segmentation, respectively. 
We use [Deeplabv3+](https://github.com/VainF/DeepLabV3Plus-Pytorch) (Chen et al., 2018) as our segmentation network (b). 
A standard binary classification network was designed as the discriminator (c) in this semi-supervised adversarial learning framework.
